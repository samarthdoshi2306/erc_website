Having always heard from the seniors “Elec Club, God Club hai!”, I got to see the godliness for the first time during the XLR8 event.

XLR8 was not only a tech event it was a new experience. The night outs in TL followed by the fundae sessions by the conveners made the experience memorable. I remember Aviniel suggesting a freshie to watch GOT instead of just studying. Sudeep motivating me and my team not to give up! Few from WnCC busy giving acads fundae.

Events kept up coming with difficulty level rising, but the events had one thing consistent, which was ‘enjoyment’. Hope the enjoyment doze continues!
